        <h1>Hi! I'm <strong>Carlos Silva</strong>. <br /></h1>
        <p>
          I'm a Web Developer <br />
          with a life long passion for tech. Early on into high school I had set
          my mind into becoming a welder (Fire,Eletric Arks,Sparks,Molten Metal,
          That one scene of Iron Man hammering his MKI helmet (1:35:45)). It
          wasn't until I got some experience in the field that I realized that I
          had an itch I couldn't scratch. I lacked the mental challenge, there
          wasn't enough problem solving to keep me interested. That's when I
          found out about Web Development. After dipping my toes into coding, I
          instantly fell in love. There always seems to be the next framework
          being built, fixing bugs, learning the several ways to do the same
          task, the instant satisfaction of getting a piece of code working.
          It's almost never ending, and I can't wait to keep on learning.

            <h3>StreetCoder I</h3>
            <p>
              Developed in Python3, Street Coder is a terminal turnbased
              fighting game, that is heavily influenced by the games I grew up
              playing (Pokemon fighting gameplay with characters from my
              favorite franchises). Players have the option to choose from four
              different characters, each with two unique moves and personal
              stats. Once the player has chosen their character they’ll choose
              an opponent and the fight will begin. Every turn the player
              chooses their desired move and the opponent is ai controlled to
              use one of its two attacks, the fight continues until someone’s
              health reaches zero.
